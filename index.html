      Hello you ambitious learner!</p>
    <p>
    So we hired Google’s best data scientists for the weekend to analyze the Placement Survey data. The 20 person team spun webs of algorithms to play with the data to test various scenarios until they found the perfect cohort match for each camper.

    Before finalizing the cohort spots, the whole team flew to Japan to complete a dual yoga and meditation retreat so as to ensure they had made the right conclusions for each cohort placement. We held a 3-hour meeting with the Emperor of Japan to get his feedback. Quincy Larson was live on Skype for the whole meeting.

    When the plane landed from Japan we headed to the seaside to witness the most glorious sunset while we wrote out the the final cohort list in ink. Someone saw a dolphin jump in the distance.
    We had a crazy celebration after, and coded a Tribute Page to the whole process. MPJ might have even wrote a poem called “The Chingu Animals, the hungriest learners on FCC”.

    </p>
    <p>Let’s learn, level-up to new levels and build, shall we?</p>

    <ol class="mb4 mt0">
      <li class="pv2">Say hello, chat a bit, and write your intro. Don’t be shy, everyone here is super friendly. Feel free to give a warm welcome to new members as they come in. :)</li>
      <li class="pv2">Take some time to play around and get used to slack. I recommend downloading the desktop app and mobile app as well. It’ll make your cohort life much better, and the Slack app is wonderfully designed.</li>
      <li class="pv2">You’ll see that there are only 3 channels at first: #chingu-news, #general, and #intros-your-story. Once most people join, I’ll add the other channels (the other channels are explained below). I usually make the other channels on the 2nd or 3rd day. </li>

      AN EXAMPLE (of an excellent intro)

      <p class="i mb2">

      Hi, everyone!  My name is Den, and I live in Pennsylvania (USA).

      My Backstory:

      I've worked odd jobs most of my life (from unloading trucks to canvassing door-to-door), never really knowing what I wanted to do.  At least until I found my way into an office job and started fiddling around with Excel VBA.  (Our processes were terribly repetitive, and I was getting sick of doing them every day).  I managed to build a few macros, got myself promoted to a low-level analyst position, and fell in love with coding.   I know now that Software Development is what I want to do.

      Coding History:

      I'm pretty confident in my VBA abilities.  I spent the last year trying to learn python, but I'm not really sure I came away with anything practical from it.  Learning web development, though, appeals to me, so I joined FCC.  I'm at the early JS portfolio projects right now (having just finished the Random Quote Generator).
      My goal is make web apps (and, hopefully, to be gainfully employed in doing so).

      Interests (aka feel free to message me if you also like any of these):

      Coffee, Sci-Fi/Fantasy novels, PC Games (currently playing Civ VI and Stardew Valley), and anime.

      Happy to be here!

        Accountability buddies are a secret weapon to improving your skillset.
      </span>
       We’re all human, and our motivation will go up and down. Having someone to share your goals with and hold you accountable is an enormous asset.

Trouble maintaining motivation is the most common place of failure for people learning to code, so we take it seriously. </p>
<img class="mb4" src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/tester-484dd.appspot.com/o/image12.png?alt=media&token=7a7fdacc-87cd-45ed-87be-deb07715c18e" />
<p>

  We believe people coming together with shared goals and ambitions is a huge asset, but why not connect on personal interests and specific skillsets?
  <span class="b">People are more likely to collaborate and help each other when they build friendships. </span> When people collaborate and help each other, they are more likely to do things like improve, create projects, and get a job.

<span class="b">So if you find yourself in a cluster, dive in and have fun!</span>
</p>

<p>
  The cohorts have at least 5 weekends.
  <span class="b">The Pair Programming Festivals are held on the 1st and 3rd weekends of each cohort. </span>

We encourage pair-programming b/c it’s one of the most effective ways to level up.
“HOW DID I NEVER DO THAT BEFORE?!” is a common response we get after this festival.

Also, for this cohort we’re going to try out setting up Regular Pair Programming partners for people who want to try. In the past we’ve had a few people who did this and they found it extremely beneficial.

  The ZELDA doc is where you can find many of the traditional opportunities Chingu offers. You can find out about the study-groups, find projects, and other useful links.

<span class="b">The ZELDA doc will be released on the 4th day after everyone is in and settled. :)</span>
</p>
<img class="mb4" src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/tester-484dd.appspot.com/o/image05.png?alt=media&token=c711f52a-1ffa-4892-8e5e-96411068f573" />
<p>

  A lot of people wrote that they desperately want a way to get involved in team projects and concentrated study groups. We can facilitate level-ups in a variety of ways. Our groups fleet can be split between Project and Study-Group Opportunities.
</p>
<p>
  Right now we’re focusing on revamping Campfire-Stories and building a team around it so that we can continuously update its content and give members a real world website to work out (invaluable experience to have and talk about in a future job interview).

</p>
    <img class="mb4" src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/tester-484dd.appspot.com/o/image01.png?alt=media&token=eeb5a4e3-f7c6-4ed3-8fa0-c597f2b9a588" />

      <a class=" dim black" href="www.campfire-stories.xyz">Campfire-Stories</a> is a real-life-in-the-wild full-stack remix of the famous Humans of New York. Ours is not geared towards New Yorkians, but programmers and technologists of the world.

So far we’ve interviewed over 30 people, including Quincy Larson, for this site. We intend on interviewing 300 more.

      Bots Team — I’m not sure if you’ve noticed, but bots are taking over these days, and there are now job titles like Bot Designer.

If you’re interested in learning more about the world of bots and building one, this is the team for you.

    <p>Note: we’re going to be experimenting with different ways to improve these study-groups in the February-March cohorts, so keep your eye out for that! :)</p>
      <ul class="list mb4">
        <li class="pv3">
          <span class="b">#bestdevstudygroup </span> — The now infamous P1xt Guides have a study-group in ChinguCentral. If you’ve seen the guides, you probably know what to expect. Members come together to help each other as they go through the Indiana-Jones-like coding journey.
        </li>
        <li class="pv3">
          <span class="b">#YDKJSM</span> — This stands for You Don’t Know Javascript, which is a book series by Kyle Simpson that is a starting component of P1xt’s Guides. Chingus come together for group discussions, help, venting, and video sessions for this awesome book series.
        </li>
        <li class="pv3">
          <span class="b">#JOBS-talk-prep </span> - This is a new channel we will be starting this cohort. It will be a place for people who are actively looking for dev-jobs and those who have gone through the experience and want to share any tips or stories. I’m thinking it might be helpful to do mock-interviews and practice whiteboarding.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <img class="mb4" src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/tester-484dd.appspot.com/o/image04.png?alt=media&token=e4bacdc8-2bc5-4366-a400-60c63c9530fa" />
    <p>
      Chingu Central is a second slack group that houses many members from the other cohorts. It’s a place to meet other people and acts like a main train station. It’s also where you can join the study groups and other groups or projects that may be created in the future.</p>
      <p class="b">
        NOTE: If this is your first cohort, you will get an invite to ChinguCentral at the end of your first week.
      </p>
      <img class="mb4" src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/tester-484dd.appspot.com/o/image15.png?alt=media&token=910acd37-acc3-4844-9e35-36928313b971" />

      <p>
      Note -  I purposely change the settings to make the cohorts adaptable and customizable. In the past, people have made their own channels such as: #daily-algorithms, #humanlanguages, #job-talk, #philosophy, #motivation as well as various ones for group projects that start organically in the cohort.
            </p>
      <ul class="list mb4">
        <li class="pv3">
          <span class="b">#chingu-news </span> — This is where I’ll post links to the Weekly Updates and any important news. Try to check this every so often to make sure you don’t miss out on any opportunities.
        </li>
        <li class="pv3">
          <span class="b">#general</span> — People can and do talk about anything and everything here. Mostly it’s about coding, what people are working on, or super random topics like “does where you live have gas station attendants?” ;p  It’s an awesome place!
        </li>
        <li class="pv3">
          <span class="b">#dev-help </span> - Have a question about code? About anything dev-related? Ask your cohort-mates here!
        </li>
        <li class="pv3">
          <span class="b">#showcase-feedback </span> - Finished a project? Want to show off what you worked so hard to make? Want feedback? Post it here! Also, feel free to post about any tutorials, books, or resources you’ve finished!
        </li>
      </ul>
